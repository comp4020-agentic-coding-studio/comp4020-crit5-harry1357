# COMP4020 prototype

This is your starter repo for a COMP4020 prototype: a static site written in
HTML/CSS/TypeScript that builds to plain HTML/CSS/JS and deploys to GitHub
Pages. The **deployed site is what gets marked** --- not this repo, and not "it
works on my machine". It's marked live in Chrome against the deployed URL at two
viewports --- 1920×1080 (desktop) and 390×844 (phone) --- and both count in
full, so make that artefact good at both and use the checks below to know
whether it is.

What you're building this week — the spec — is published on the course website,
and this repo's name tells you which deliverable it is. Run the course plugin's
**start** skill at the start of each week: it pulls the right spec from the
course API, carries your harness forward from last week, and helps you turn the
spec's checkable lines into tests of your own. Read the spec before you build,
and see `spec/README.md` for how the checks in this repo relate to it.

## How to work in here

- Keep the dev server running (`pnpm dev`) so you see changes as you make them.
- Before you push, run `pnpm check`. It runs most of what CI runs --- build,
  lint, and the spec --- so you catch those in seconds instead of waiting for
  the pipeline. The links check, the evidence check, the secrets scan, and the
  deploy itself only run in CI; run `pnpm dlx linkinator ./dist --silent`
  locally against a fresh `pnpm build` for the links check without waiting for
  CI.
- To see what the page actually looks like rather than what you assume it looks
  like, open it in a browser (the `agent-browser` CLI, documented on
  [the course site](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/backpressure/#agent-browser-the-rendered-page-as-ground-truth),
  works well for this). The rendered page is the truth; your mental model of it
  isn't.
- When a check fails, read its output before changing anything. Each check below
  names what it measures, and the failure message is the instruction: it tells
  you the file, the line, or the contract. Treat a red check as authoritative
  --- the page is wrong until the check is green, not until you decide it should
  be.
- Commit when the checks pass. Never commit a red state.

## The link-preview card

`public/card.png` (1200×630) is the image a shared link shows, and `index.html`'s
head points at it. Replace it and the `description` meta, and copy the head block
into any new page --- the invariants now assert both a meta description and an
`og:image` on every page the build emits. The card URL resolves against the page
that names it, like any link, so `./card.png` is wrong one directory down, and
nothing in CI checks that it resolves; look at the deployed head when you add
pages.

## The checks (your sensors)

CI runs these on every push once your repo is public. GitHub's checks UI shows
two jobs, `check` and `deploy` --- not one status per sensor below --- and
within `check` the steps run in sequence (`pnpm check` chains typecheck, build,
lint, and the spec with `&&`), so an early failure like a broken build stops the
later sensors from running for that push; fix it and push again to see the rest.
While the repo is private (all week, until you ship) the CI jobs stay skipped
--- `pnpm check` is the same roster on your machine, and it's the faster loop
anyway. They aren't hoops. Each is a different way of finding out something true
about the site that you can't reliably see by looking at it.

They also carry a mark at a crit: the sweep runs fifteen minutes after your
cutoff, and green checks there are worth half that week's shipped mark. Still
running counts as not green, so ship with time for CI to finish.

- **typecheck** --- `tsc --noEmit` runs first in `pnpm check`, so a type error
  stops the roster before the build even starts. The types are extra
  backpressure: a red here is the compiler telling you a claim in the code is
  false.
- **build** --- the site must build (`pnpm build`). A build failure means the
  deployed site is broken or stale, so nothing else matters until this is green.
- **deploy / online** --- the live GitHub Pages URL must load and return the
  page you expect. An asset that 404s on the deployed URL counts as broken even
  if it loads locally.
- **spec** --- `spec/invariants.test.ts` asserts what's true of any good
  website, whatever the week's brief asks; the tests you write for the week's
  own spec run alongside it (any `spec/*.test.ts`). A failure names the contract
  you haven't met yet.
- **lint** --- `stylelint` for CSS, `oxlint` for TypeScript. Flags code that's
  wrong, fragile, or non-idiomatic. Read the rule it names.
- **tests** --- any other tests you write, wherever you put them (co-located
  with your source is fine, not just `spec/`), must pass. Vitest picks up both
  this and the spec suite in one `vitest run`, the last step of `pnpm check`. A
  failing test is a claim about the site that's no longer true.
- **evidence** (`pnpm check:evidence`) --- checks your process evidence:
  `PROCESS.md`'s citations resolve to real commits, the reflection the marker
  reads is in `reflections/`, and your `CLAUDE.md` is present. The expected
  filename is derived from this repo's name alone, offline --- no course API
  call --- so `comp4020-crit5-…` wants exactly `reflections/crit-5.md`. Evidence
  gates the deploy --- `deploy` needs `check` to pass, so failing evidence
  blocks the deploy alongside everything else. See
  [Your process is part of the mark](#your-process-is-part-of-the-mark) below,
  and the course website's
  [assessment page](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/assessment/#what-you-submit)
  for what counts as evidence.
- **links** --- internal links must resolve. A broken link is a dead end you
  didn't mean to ship.
- **secrets** --- the repo is scanned for committed credentials. Never put a
  key, token, or password in a tracked file. If one leaks, rotate it. A local
  pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, installed by `pnpm install`) also
  blocks any commit containing something shaped like an API key --- by the time
  CI sees a key it's already pushed, so the hook is the sensor that matters.

Nothing here measures **accessibility** or **performance** --- wiring those
sensors (`axe-core`, Lighthouse, or whatever you choose) is your work, and later
in the course the spec will ask you to show how you tested both. When you do,
read a green performance result honestly: it's a lab estimate from one run on a
CI machine, not proof the site is fast for real users.

## The stack is swappable

Out of the box this is plain HTML/CSS/TypeScript on Vite, and every `.html` file
in the repo is a page: add pages, link them, and the build picks them up with no
config. That's a default, not a rule (unless the week's spec says otherwise).
You can swap in Astro or any other static generator, because nothing in CI names
a tool --- the whole contract is:

- `pnpm build` emits the complete site into `dist/`
- the `package.json` scripts (`check`, `check:evidence`, `build`) keep working
- whatever lands in `dist/` still passes the invariants in `spec/`

Two things bite in a swap. The deployed site lives under a path
(`…github.io/<repo>/`), so configure your generator's base path --- this
template's Vite config uses relative asset URLs to sidestep that, but most
generators (Astro included) need `base` set explicitly, and getting it wrong
looks fine locally while every asset 404s on the live URL. And commit the
updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`: CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`.

## Astro on this template (learned in crit 2)

- **Use relative URLs, not `base`.** Setting Astro's `base` to the repo name
  makes assets resolve once deployed but breaks the links check, which crawls
  `dist/` as the site root and sees `/<repo>/…` as a 404. Relative URLs are
  correct in both places. The config that does it:
  `build: { format: "file", assetsPrefix: "." }`. `format: "file"` is what makes
  it work — every page lands at the top level of `dist/`, so `./menu.html` means
  the same thing from every page; with the default directory format each page
  sits a level deeper and would need its own `../`.
- `astro check` replaces `tsc --noEmit` as the typecheck script.
- Astro's image pipeline pulls in `sharp`, which needs
  `allowBuilds: { sharp: true }` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or install warns.

## Verifying the rendered page

The rendered page is ground truth --- but only if you've checked you're
rendering the right page at the right size. Both failed here in one session.

- **The shell's working directory resets between commands.** `serve dist` without
  an explicit path silently served *last week's repo*. Always pass an absolute
  path: `python3 -m http.server 8099 --directory "$PWD/dist"`.
- **Chrome's headless mode enforces a ~500px minimum window.** `--window-size=390,844`
  lays the page out at 500px and then *crops* the screenshot to 390, which looks
  exactly like horizontal overflow that isn't there. Don't fix a bug you've only
  seen in a picture.
- **To measure a real phone viewport**, load the page in a **same-origin** iframe
  (`<iframe src="./index.html" style="width:390px">`) — an iframe gets its own
  viewport *and* its own media-query context — then read
  `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` and flag any element whose
  `getBoundingClientRect().right` exceeds the width. A number beats a screenshot.
  Cross-origin (a different port) yields a null `contentDocument` and a probe
  that silently reports nothing.
- **The shell here is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted variables.**
  `set -- $spec` with `spec="390 520"` gives *one* argument, not two, so a loop
  that is correct in bash quietly passes `--window-size=,900`. Chrome ignores
  the malformed flag, lays out at its own default width, and the probe reports
  confident numbers for a viewport you never tested. Split explicitly
  (`${=spec}`) or use separate variables.
- **Drive the page from the probe rather than screenshotting a live one.** Have
  the harness page pause the simulation, reset it, and step a fixed number of
  ticks before measuring, so two runs are comparable. Give the harness page a
  loud background colour (`#f0f`) --- it makes the boundary of the real
  viewport unmistakable instead of blending into the page's own dark ground.

## Web Audio, and the cold open (learned in crit 4)

- **A touch grants user activation on `touchend`, never on `touchstart`.** A
  mouse grants it on `mousedown` and a key on `keydown`, so a note that starts
  on pointerdown sounds instantly on a desktop and *not at all* on a phone. Every
  test can be green while the marking viewport is silent.
- **A suspended AudioContext's `currentTime` does not advance.** So the damage
  is worse than a late note: press and release both land on time 0, the envelope
  collapses to zero length, and the first tap is silent even once audio starts.
  Don't schedule into a suspended context --- hold the note, resume, and start it
  for real on the way out of the suspension. A tap that was already released by
  then needs a short fixed duration or it is still inaudible.
- Call `resume()` from the up-handlers as well as the down-handlers. That is the
  only moment a touchscreen will grant the activation.
- **A lowpass sweep over a sine does nothing** --- there are no harmonics above
  the fundamental to remove. If a filter is the expressive control, the
  oscillator has to be `sawtooth` or similar.
- **Key-track the filter.** A fixed cutoff floor that sits below a high note's
  fundamental filters the note itself away, and the key reads as broken rather
  than dark. Floor the cutoff at a multiple of the fundamental --- and expect
  that to mean the nominal bottom of the stated range is never actually reached.
- Schedule every gain change (`setValueAtTime` / `linearRampToValueAtTime` /
  `setTargetAtTime`). A bare `gain.value =` mid-note steps the signal and clicks.
  Releasing mid-attack is common, so release from where the ramp actually got to,
  not from the peak.

## Driving the real browser over CDP

`agent-browser` isn't installed here. Chrome's DevTools Protocol needs no
dependencies at all --- Node has a global `WebSocket` --- and it is strictly
better than screenshotting for anything interactive.

- Launch with `--headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=<tmp>`,
  read `webSocketDebuggerUrl` from `http://localhost:9222/json/version`, then
  `Target.createTarget` -> `Target.attachToTarget {flatten: true}` and send
  session-scoped commands.
- **`Input.dispatchMouseEvent` / `dispatchKeyEvent` / `dispatchTouchEvent` are
  trusted events.** `navigator.userActivation.hasBeenActive` flips to true after
  one. A `dispatchEvent` from page script does not, so anything gated on a user
  gesture can only be tested this way.
- **`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` gives a true 390px viewport** and
  sidesteps the headless ~500px minimum window entirely --- no iframe needed, and
  no cropped screenshot pretending to be overflow. Add
  `Emulation.setTouchEmulationEnabled` for touch.
- `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` checks the
  reduced-motion path without relaunching the browser.
- **To hear whether the page makes sound, tap the graph.** Install a recording
  subclass of `AudioContext` via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` so it is
  in place before the page's own module runs, then connect an `AnalyserNode` to
  the master gain and read `getFloatTimeDomainData`. A non-zero peak is evidence
  of actual signal --- not that it sounds good, but that it isn't silence.
  Headless Chrome does render audio.
- **Check your click is on screen.** Headless defaults to a small window; a
  probe that clicks at y=500 in a 469px-tall viewport reports "nothing happened"
  and looks exactly like a broken handler. Compute coordinates from
  `getBoundingClientRect()`, never from assumption.
- `--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required` makes audio easy to test and
  **disables the exact thing the cold open depends on**. Verify the cold open in
  a browser without it.

## Driving an interactive page over CDP (learned in crit 5)

The CDP notes above get you a browser. These are the things that made probes
lie once they were driving a page that animates.

- **Wait for a *new* node, not for *a* node.** A list that fades out for 110ms
  before it is replaced still matches `querySelectorAll(sel).length === 3` the
  instant after the click, so the probe clicks the dying list, the app's own
  re-entry guard swallows it, and the run silently stalls one step behind while
  every assertion still reads plausibly. Tag the current node
  (`el.dataset.stale = "1"`), then wait for one without the tag.
- **`Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is a
  test-speed lever, not just an a11y check.** It collapsed a 45-second scripted
  playthrough to about eight seconds, which is the difference between checking
  all four endings and checking one.
- **To prove a typewriter types, sample it.** Poll the target element every
  ~70ms and collect the distinct values: 16 growing prefixes is evidence,
  a screenshot of finished text is not. Same for skip --- capture the length
  mid-line, dispatch the click, assert the length jumps within ~120ms.
- **"Always visible" is a claim about a scrolled page.** A header carrying a
  status indicator passes every check at load and silently violates the spec two
  screens down. Assert it from a scrolled state (`getBoundingClientRect().top >=
  0 && .bottom <= innerHeight` after the run), or make it `position: sticky` and
  prove it there.

## Contrast is checkable arithmetic, so check it

`spec/contrast.test.ts` reads the custom properties back out of the CSS the
build emitted and does the WCAG maths on the pairs the stylesheet actually
claims. It exists because `--ink-faint` shipped at 3.01:1 and looked perfectly
fine in a screenshot; axe under jsdom returns "incomplete" for every node and
would never have said so.

- Read the **built** CSS, not the source. A token that gets renamed, minified
  away or overridden then fails loudly instead of quietly passing.
- Assert the *gap* between two inks, not only each one's floor. Two tokens can
  both clear 4.5:1 and still have collapsed into each other, losing a
  distinction the design depends on.

## Content bugs that read as code bugs

- **A reply that repeats the player's answer verbatim looks like a duplicated
  line, not like a flat echo.** Character-wise an interrogator repeating your
  words back is exactly right; on screen, the identical string twice in a row
  reads as a render bug. Shorten the echo ("At home." -> "Home.") so it is
  visibly a reply.
- **A rotating set of lines indexed off a counter that only goes up will
  collide.** Picking an interjection with `transcript.length % set.length`
  looks evenly distributed and isn't: two moments four answers apart draw the
  same line, and hearing it twice in one run reads as a loop, not as a
  character. Advance a cursor instead, and reset it when the run resets.
- **A callback that quotes the previous answer is a follow-up, not a callback.**
  The effect only exists at distance --- count the questions between where the
  claim went on the record and where it gets read back, and treat anything under
  three as flavour rather than as the record being tracked.
- **A `Map` keyed by line index loses the second relationship a line is in.**
  One answer can be half of two different contradictions; `marked.set(line, n)`
  silently overwrote the first, so the report showed a pair with no partner ---
  the exact opposite of the feature. Collect into an array and render one mark
  per relationship.

## More stack facts

- **Vite leaves `url(#fragment)` alone.** In-document SVG filter references
  (`filter: url("#ink-bleed")`) survive the build; only real asset URLs get
  rewritten. Grep `dist/` for the fragment once to confirm rather than assuming.
- **stylelint forces the `text-decoration` shorthand** when you write the line,
  style, colour and thickness longhands together
  (`declaration-block-no-redundant-longhand-properties`), but
  `text-underline-offset` and `text-decoration-skip-ink` are not part of the
  shorthand and stay separate. `value-keyword-case` also wants
  `optimizelegibility`, not the spec's camelCase.
- **Render the link-preview card, don't hand-draw it.** The card is 1200x630 of
  HTML screenshotted through the same CDP session, reusing the site's own
  tokens, so it cannot drift from the design it advertises.

## Web Audio, the second time (learned in crit 5)

Crit 4's notes above are about getting a context to *start*. These are about
getting a scheduled sound to actually exist once it has.

- **`currentTime` is already the past.** It is the start of the render quantum
  that has gone, so an envelope pinned to it is partly behind the clock --- and
  a short one (8ms) can land entirely behind it, in which case the gain param
  renders as its own end state and the voice is silent. Schedule every voice a
  few milliseconds ahead (`currentTime + 0.008`). Same family as the suspended
  context trap: the sound is inaudible for a clock reason, not a routing one.
- **Give simultaneous voices a floor on how close they can land.** Text that
  arrives all at once (the reduced-motion path) fires a dozen voices on one
  instant, which sums into a thump rather than reading as typing. A
  `nextFree = max(now + lookahead, nextFree + gap)` cursor spreads them and is
  inert when the calls are already far apart.
- **Count nodes, don't just listen.** Patching `createBufferSource` and
  `createOscillator` to record every `start()` turns "does it sound right" into
  arithmetic: 51 voices over 137 characters matched
  `ceil(letters/3) + 2 per carriage` exactly, which is a far stronger claim than
  any spectrum reading. Only the thud uses an oscillator, so counting
  oscillators proves *which* sound fired.
- **The frequency domain lies about transients.** A 2048-sample FFT window is
  ~43ms; an 8ms click is smeared across it and reads ~10dB quieter than a 50ms
  sound that fills it. Compare short sounds by peak amplitude in the time
  domain (`getFloatTimeDomainData` sampled every 8ms, clustered into events),
  not by `getFloatFrequencyData`.
- **Reading the analyser as soon as the DOM settles is a race.** With motion
  off the text lands instantly, so the wait that used to cover the sound is gone
  and the peak reads 0.0000 --- identical to broken audio, and I "fixed" it once
  before noticing. Let the audio settle before measuring.
- **A motion preference is not a sound preference.** Turning off the typewriter
  removes the per-character loop, and with it every keystroke sound, silently.
  If reduced motion is meant to keep audio, something has to sound on the path
  where nothing is being typed.
- **A control fixed to the viewport sits on a different ground at each
  viewport.** The mute mark is on the desk at 1920 and on the page at 390,
  because the page fills the phone. One ink, two grounds: pick it to clear 3:1
  (WCAG 1.4.11, not 4.5 --- it is a graphic, not text) against both, and hold it
  there with a test.

## Accessibility sensors

Nothing in the starter measures accessibility, so wire it yourself --- and be
honest about what each tool actually covers.

- `axe-core` runs over the built HTML under jsdom and catches structural
  problems (landmarks, labels, heading order, duplicate ids).
- **Run axe *inside* the jsdom realm, not against it.** Construct the DOM with
  `runScripts: "dangerously"`, `dom.window.eval(readFileSync(require.resolve("axe-core")))`,
  then call `dom.window.axe.run(dom.window.document, …)`. The alternative is
  shimming a dozen browser globals onto `globalThis` and it breaks on every axe
  upgrade. Pass a `VirtualConsole` to swallow jsdom's complaints about module
  scripts it can't execute.
- **Check the sensor is actually looking.** A green axe run and a run that
  silently loaded nothing look identical from the test output. Assert
  `results.passes.length` is above a floor, as a standing test rather than a
  one-off print, so the sensor fails loudly if it ever stops seeing the page.
  `landmark-one-main` and `page-has-heading-one` come back *incomplete* under
  jsdom because visibility needs layout --- the invariants already assert both,
  so that gap is covered elsewhere, not ignored.
- **Chrome has `--force-prefers-reduced-motion`.** Use it to verify the
  reduced-motion path renders what you think it does, rather than trusting the
  media query by inspection.
- A control's accessible name has to distinguish it from its siblings. Three
  sliders all named "Agility" are three identical announcements; append a
  visually hidden `for Unit A` so the name is "Agility for Unit A".
- Don't reach for `<output>` as a read-only value display. Its implicit role is
  `status`, so it is a live region, and it will double-announce every value the
  control it mirrors already reports. A plain `<span>` is correct.
- **axe cannot judge contrast under jsdom** — no layout, no computed colour, so
  `color-contrast` returns "incomplete" for every node. Disable that rule
  explicitly and check the palette arithmetically instead; leaving it enabled
  looks like coverage you don't have.
- Every `<h1>` must sit inside a landmark. A full-bleed hero placed between
  `<header>` and `<main>` trips axe's `region` rule — put it inside `<main>`.
- A colour token that's legible on one background is not legible on all of them.
  When a class is used on both the dark hero and the light page, scope the
  bright variant to the hero and make the *dark* value the default.

## CSS conventions

- Don't use the `padding` / `margin` shorthand on a class that shares an element
  with a layout class --- `padding: 2.5rem 0 4rem` on `.page` silently reset
  `.wrap`'s horizontal padding to `0`. Use `padding-block` / `padding-inline`.
- Declare lower-specificity selectors before higher ones or stylelint's
  `no-descending-specificity` fails (e.g. `.inline-list li` must come before
  `.menu-list li:last-child`). This bites across *sections* too: a
  `.mechanism .haste-factor` written down in the prose block still has to
  precede `.channel[data-hasted="true"] .haste-factor` written up in the
  components block.
- **Same trap as the shorthand one, different property: don't put
  `max-inline-size` on an element that already carries `.wrap`.** `.wrap`
  centres its own box with `margin-inline: auto`, so narrowing it centres the
  narrow column and silently breaks the left edge every other section shares.
  Nest a child (`<div class="wrap"><div class="prose">`) instead.
- **stylelint-config-standard rejects BEM.** `selector-class-pattern` is
  kebab-case only, so `channel__name` and `channel--hasted` both fail. Use
  `channel-name`, and state classes like `.is-acting` or a `data-` attribute.
- **Media queries must use range notation** (`media-feature-range-notation:
  context`): `@media (width <= 46rem)`, never `(max-width: 46rem)`.
- **Alpha notation splits by where the value sits.** Inside a colour function
  it must be a percentage (`rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)`); as the `opacity` *property* it
  must be a bare number (`opacity: 0`, not `0%`). `alpha-value-notation`
  exempts `opacity`, so the one rule contradicts itself across the two places
  and only the linter will tell you which is which. Colour functions are modern
  (`rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)`), and a blank line between two declarations inside one
  rule fails `declaration-empty-line-before`.
- **A comment between two declarations fails `comment-empty-line-before`,** and
  adding the blank line it asks for then risks the declaration rule above.
  Put the comment above the whole rule instead of inside it.

## Typography

- **IBM Plex Mono squashes U+00BD (`½`) into a single monospace cell** and it
  renders as an illegible smudge next to a `×`. Write `1/2` --- three cells,
  legible, and it matches how the source documentation writes it.
- Reserve the mono face for values the page actually computes. Once it is also
  used for eyebrows and labels it stops meaning "this is a measured number".

## TypeScript on this template

- **Flow narrowing does not reach hoisted `function` declarations.**
  `const root = doc.querySelector(…); if (!root) return;` still leaves `root`
  possibly-null inside a `function foo()` declared further down, because the
  compiler can't prove the function isn't called before the guard. Re-bind with
  an explicit annotation (`const root: HTMLElement = found;`) rather than
  reaching for `!`.
- **`types: ["node"]` means a bare `setInterval` is Node's**, which returns a
  `Timeout`. `window.setInterval` returns a `number`. Type the handle
  `number | null` when you call it through `document.defaultView`.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on, so type-only imports must say `import type`.

## Your process is part of the mark

The deployed page is only half of it. How you got there is marked too: your
commit history, your agent files, and the decisions visible across them. The
checks above can't see any of that, so a person reads it directly --- which
means building legibly is part of building well.

- **Commit as you go.** Small, frequent commits are the record of how the work
  came together, and that record is read, not just the final state. A trail that
  grew alongside the code is the strongest evidence of your process; a single
  dump the night before is the weakest.
- **Keep a process overview** (`PROCESS.md`). A short reading-guide, not an
  essay: what you built, the moments that mattered --- each pointing at a
  commit, a `CLAUDE.md` change, or a prompt and the commit it produced --- and
  where to look in the history. It points a marker at the evidence; it doesn't
  stand in for it, and claims the history doesn't back don't count. The
  `PROCESS.md` in this repo is a template showing the shape and the citation
  format (link text the commit hash or range, target the commit or compare URL);
  `pnpm check:evidence` verifies your citations resolve to real commits before
  you ship. Markers follow those citations and don't trawl the repo for evidence
  you didn't cite.
- **Write your reflection in `reflections/`** --- a short markdown file in this
  repo, named for the deliverable it answers, so the number in the filename is
  the number in this repo's name (`crit-1.md` in `comp4020-crit1-<you>`,
  `assignment-1.md` in `comp4020-ass1-<you>`); `reflections/README.md` has the
  full rule. `pnpm check:evidence` checks for that exact name, derived offline
  from the repo name, not merely the presence of any well-named file. It answers the two
  standing prompts: the breakthrough that moved the work forward, and what this
  work changed about the developer you want to be. It stays out of the deployed
  site. It's due at the cutoff, and if it isn't in the repo by then the week
  doesn't count as shipped, however good the prototype is.
- **This file is process evidence.** The harness you build to direct the agent,
  this `CLAUDE.md` and any `AGENTS.md`, is itself read as part of how you
  worked. Keep it honest and current (see below).

You don't need a name, a student number, or any identity file in the repo: we
know whose repo it is. Spend the effort on the work.

## This file is yours

This CLAUDE.md is a starting point, not a fixed rulebook. As you learn what your
prototype needs --- a convention to hold the agent to, a sensor that keeps
catching you out, a fact about the stack the agent keeps getting wrong --- write
it down here. Growing this file is the work of harness engineering, and the gap
between this boilerplate and your own version is part of what your prototype
says about the developer you're becoming.

This file and the sensors you wire into `check` carry across the course ---
both come with you into next week's repo. The prototype doesn't: source, and
the tests answering this week's published spec, stay behind. `spec/README.md`
draws the line.
